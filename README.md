# Data Science Project for Finance

In this project we will analyze and visualize historical financial data using pandas, numpy and different visualization libraries. To get started, see `notebooks/project_description.ipynb` file. 

We will use the git feature branch workflow where all work is done on a separate branch. See the following guide here:

Create a feature branch with a new notebook and do all your work there. Additionally, you should consider adding your code to a Python script in the `scripts/` folder. Scripts are easier for version control whereas jupyter notebooks are not - but they are good for data science exploration. 

I will add more detailed instructions to help guide you along the way. Have fun!
