    "where the ticker symbol can be anything, e.g., SPY, NVDA, etc. This will return the stock price at 1 minute intervals for the last day. The output will be a ```pandas.DataFrame``` with columns for the open, close, etc. prices, indexed by the datetime. Use the ```pandas.Grouper``` function to group the dataset in 15 minute increments and use the ```agg``` function to perform operations on those groups, e.g., to get the lowest or first price within that 15 minute interval, etc. \n",

    "Finally, for plotting, feel free to use whatever you want, but try to use an interactive plotting library like vega altair, which allows you to hover over points on the graph to see the corresponding values. This last part can be a little tricky but it'll look nice. Here is an example. \n",
